			    		<p>Well...You asked for it so we want to deliver!</p>
							<p>We were so stoked with the turnout, feedback, and success of our first ever virtual run last year, that we wanted to do it again...and again...and again! This year we are launching our MTN OPS Keep Hammering Virtual Series that will be again hosted by the man himself, Cam Hanes. The Series will consist of 3 seperate run events, including a 15K, 20K, and 25K. With two challenge divisions to choose from for each run, you'll have the chance to compete and push yourself at any level, remember NOBODY CARES...RUN HARDER!</p>
